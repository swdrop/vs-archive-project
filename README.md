# vs-archive-project

Preliminary plans for the Vin Scelsa Archive Project, developed for future work in collaboration with [Fordham University Libraries](https://www.fordham.edu/resources/libraries/) and [WFUV](http://wfuv.org). 
- The goal of the overall project is to reformat Vin's collection of audio interview recordings and make them as accessible as copyright and storage will allow. 
- The goal of this GitHub repository is to (eventually) capture metadata and transcriptions for the interviews as well as provide status and workflow documentation.
