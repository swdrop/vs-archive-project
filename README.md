# vs-archive-project

Preliminary plans for the Vin Scelsa Archive Project, developed for (hopeful) future work in collaboration with [Fordham University Libraries](https://www.fordham.edu/resources/libraries/) and [WFUV](http://wfuv.org). 
- The goal of the overall project is to reformat Vin's collection of audio interview recordings and make them as accessible as copyright and storage will allow. 
- The goal of this GitHub repository is to (eventually) capture metadata and transcriptions for the interviews as well as provide status and workflow documentation.

## Where to start for each interview:

From [/metadata](https://github.com/swdrop/vs-archive-project/tree/612b461669bf237c7dab1d20db940b0a365a5e4f/metadata) directory, download the file [vs_metadata_template.csv](https://github.com/swdrop/vs-archive-project/blob/ed7f08638c6ded2f4b809ccfba85b32ab56013a2/metadata/vs_metadata_template.csv).
2. Save file with the following naming format: yyyy-mm-dd-guest-name_metadata.csv
3. Upload metadata csv file to [vs-archive-project/interviews](https://github.com/swdrop/vs-archive-project/tree/33989127869e42d46d99c08327e7e5c07bbb2a41/interviews). This will trigger the creation of a new folder that contains the metadata csv file.
4. Check [vs-archive-project/interviews](https://github.com/swdrop/vs-archive-project/tree/33989127869e42d46d99c08327e7e5c07bbb2a41/interviews) to confirm new folder was created, and use this folder for any future file uploads related to this interview.
