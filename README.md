# vs-archive-project

Preliminary plans for the Vin Scelsa Archive Project, developed for future work in collaboration with Fordham University Libraries and WFUV. 
The goal of the overall project is to reformat Vin's interview recordings and make them as accessible as copyright and storage will allow. 
The goal of this GitHub repository is to capture metadata and transcriptions for the interviews as well as provide status and workflow documentation.
